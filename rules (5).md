- You are not allowed to ask your colleagues for help
- You are not allowed to make this challenge public in any ways
- If you do use a tool like ChatGPT and copy code from it, you must include a `Sources.md` file in your repo that explains why you used ChatGPT, what prompts you used, and what code you copied

#### Duration

- This exam ends at 4:00pm

#### Passing grade

This challenge is graded in red, yellow or green. Meaning of each grade:

- 📕 Red: you haven't completed the four mandatory sections. `Fail grade`.

- 📒 Yellow: you've completed all mandatory sections + one bonus. `Pass grade`.

- 📗 Green: you've completed all mandatory sections + 2 bonus. `Pass with honor grade`.

🚨 **If you've completed both mandatory sections, but it's not fully functional, you might still downgrade to a red.**

#### Results feedback

Correcting these assessments takes time. Please be patient with regards to getting the results of your assessments. Results will go out the following week between Monday and Tuesday.

#### How to make and submit your homework

- Use `npx create-react-app` to create a new react app
- Add these instructions to your repo as `rules.md`
- `create-react-app` will initialize a git repository for you, so don't make one yourself
- Go to `github.com` and
  - create a new `private` repository
  - make sure **NOT** to initalize with a readme/.gitignore as it will give you errors when you will try to push
  - Add the evaluator to your repository as a `collaborator` (tessawiedmann, wearethefoos)
- Add your newly created git repository as a remote to your react app
- Push the initial version of your app created by `create-react-app`
- If you need help with git/GitHub setup, you can ask a teacher
- Start your react app with `npm run start`, as usual, and start programming

#### Self assessment

#### What to expect after submitting this challenge?

- If you scored a red, a teacher will contact you for a conversation
- In case you scored yellow or green, you don't have to expect a conversation, but feel free to reach out to a teacher if you have questions

## Learning goals & some tips

For transparency and clarity, these are the main learning goals we will be testing:
- Creating components
- Nesting components and passing them data via props
- Using event listeners and event handlers, like onClick
- Designing and managing component local state with useState hook
- Using the useEffect hook to fetch data from an API using Axios
- Using react-router-dom to make static and dynamic routes
- Using npm to install packages

Additional learning goals include:
- Creating input forms and console logging the results
- Mapping, filtering, finding & sorting arrays of objects
- CSS styling
- Basic git and GitHub usage: making commits, adding remote & pushing to master

If this sounds like a large list, it is, and it's because you've learned a tremendous amount of things these past week! Don't let it scare or overwhelm you though, you have seen all these things. See the rules above for resources you are allowed to use

**TIP: Read the assignment carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from an assignment, resulting in a frustrating experience. Taking the time to read the exercise can save you time and effort.

**TIP: Don't get stuck!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you.

**TIP: Focus on the required features first!** Before moving to the bonus sections of this assessment, focus on implementing the madatory parts, then move on to the next ones.

## What are we building?

We are building a webapp for an Amsterdam GP. It has 4 main pages

- A homepage with two links
- A page where we can see the dogtors on duty
- A page where we can see a list of patients
- A page for each patient that shows the patient's details

## API

The data for this app is already available through an API. This way you can build your entire app without having to create a working API yourself.

Endpoints:

GET /dogtors

`https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/patient-doctor-data/dogtors`

GET /patients

`https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/patient-doctor-data/patients`

GET /patients/:patientId

`https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/patient-doctor-data/patients/5856675843`

## Required Features

### ❗ Feature 1 - Homepage

- The home page has 2 buttons:
  - Who is on duty: should link to the 'on duty' page
  - Patients List: should link to the 'patient list' page

### ❗ Feature 2 - on Duty Page

API endpoint: [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/patient-doctor-data/dogtors]

- On our who is on duty page, we display all the dogtors along with an indicator showing wether they are on duty
- The dogtors are displayed with their name and image
- The data must come from the API

### ❗ Feature 3 - Patients List

API endpoint: [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/patient-doctor-data/patients]

- Patients are displayed with `firstName`, `lastName`, `id` and `dateOfBirth`
- You must use a seperate component to show an individual patient
- The patients are sorted by their `lastName` in alphabetical order
- Each patient component has a `show details` button. Clicking it links to the detail page of a patient.
- The data must come from the API

### ❗ Feature 4 - Patient Details

API endpoint: [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/patient-doctor-data/patients/:id]

- The page displays the firstname, lastname, gender, dateOfBirth of a single patient
- The page displays the email, phoneNumber & prescriptions of that patient
- The data must come from the API

## Required Features

### ➕ Bonus 1 - Patient Sign Up

- There's a form where new patients can sign up
- The form contains input for first name, last name, email, phone, gender and date of birth
- Once they have signed up successfully, console.log the data from the form to console

### ➕ Bonus 2 - Patients List (filter)

API endpoint: [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/patient-doctor-data/dogtors]
API endpoint: [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Codaisseur/patient-doctor-data/patients]

- There's a select field on the page
- The select has options with the names of the three dogtors + All
- The dogtors are not hardcoded, but coming from the API
- Each patient object has a `doctorId` which corresponds with the `id` of a specific doctor. When the name of a dogtor is selected only the patients that match the `dogtorId` are displayed.

> Tip: you will need to use `filter` for this functionality

### ➕ Bonus 3 - Opening Hours

- On the homepage _and_ on the who is on duty page, we should display a phone number (hardcoded) of the practice
- We also want to indicate wether the practice is **open** or **closed** at the moment when the user visit the page (updating open or closed while the user is already on the page is not required)
- Make sure to use the same component for this on the homepage and on duty page

> Business logic: the practice is open between 08:00 and 16:59
> You can use any phone number, for example '00-000-000'
